## Purpose of this project:
Our Coffee machine will contain the ingredients to make coffee i.e.

    water
    milk
    coffee beans

Let’s say our coffee machine can hold infinite amounts of all the ingredients but initially contains nothing.

Our Coffee machine will also contain a money box which will store all the money it collects through selling but initially it is empty.

There would be different types of coffee that can be selected which will have separate prices and amounts of ingredients required. The types of coffee are:

    Espresso :
        price - $4/cup, water needed – 250 ml/cup, milk needed – 0 ml/cup, beans needed - 16/cup

    Latte :
        price - $7/cup, water needed – 350 ml/cup, milk needed – 75 ml/cup, beans needed - 20/cup

    Cappuccino :
        price - $6/cup, water needed – 200 ml/cup milk needed – 100 ml/cup beans needed - 12/cup

## Options / Choices available :
1. It has a **“buy”** option which enables the user to buy a coffee of their choice. The coffee would be dispensed only if the machine contains enough ingredients to make that coffee otherwise it will show an error message. After coffee is dispensed, money in our box will be updated as well as remaining ingredients. 

1. It has a **“fill”** option which lets us add the ingredients as the user specifies.

1. It has a **“take”** option which enables the maintainer to take the money in the money box.

1. It has a **“show”** option which enables the user to check the ingredients left in the coffee machine. There should be an “exit” option that stops the simulation.

1. It has an **“analytics”** option which will display the count of all the coffees it sold, amount it earned, ingredients it consumed.

1. In last it has an **“exit”** option which stops the simulation.

## How it demonstrates OOPs features :
In this project, I've used many OOPs(Object Oriented Programming) concepts like :

    Classes and Objects
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance

Through OOPs features my project becomes more efficient, improved code readability, enhanced code reuseability
